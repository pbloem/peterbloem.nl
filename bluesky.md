# Reach me on Bluesky

If you're on Bluesky, you can reach me by bridging to Mastodon. It basically requires you to follow a particular account to opt-in, and you're good to go. See [the detailed instructions here](https://fed.brid.gy/docs#bluesky-get-started).

You will see me on Bluesky under @pbloem.sigmoid.ap.brid.gy. You can also follow that account without bridging, but I won't see your messages, likes or follows.

# Threads

Threads is linked to the the fediverse (of which Mastodon is a part). You'll need to [enable it in the app](https://cassidyjames.com/blog/how-why-threads-fediverse-mastodon/), but once you do, you should be able to see @pbloem@sigmoid.social.
