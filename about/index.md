# About me

I'm an assistant professor at the [Learning and reasoning group](https://lr.cs.vu.nl/) at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. I specialize in the combination of Machine Learning and Knowledge Representation.

I have a fairly unfocused set of research interests, although I try to stick to general AI and machine learning related topics. My MSs thesis, way back when, was about [the application of fractal geometry to the problems of machine learning](/publications/msc-thesis). 

My [PhD thesis](/publications/thesis) dealt with the problems of [computable approximations to Kolmogorov complexity](/publications/safe-approximation), [seperating structure from noise in an objective manner](/two-problems) and, more practically, [finding meaningful subnetworks in large graphs](/publications/compression-for-motifs) using the principle of minimum description length. 

Since then, I have focused more on machine learning. See below for some of my current research directions.

# Miscellaneous projects

* In my spare time, I occasionally try my hand at writing short stories. It's mostly high-concept science fiction and some flash fiction. You can find them at [profane-tmesis.info](http://profane-tmesis.info).
* I also occasionally draw. You can find a selection of my drawings and illustrations at [unrefined.info](http://unrefined.info/).
* I wrote some oblique strategy cards for academia once. You can find them [here](oblique.tips), or [on twitter](http://twitter.com/obliquademia).
