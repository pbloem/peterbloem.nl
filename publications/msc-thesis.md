My Master's thesis was something of an exercise in lateral thinking. I had recently read [James Gleick's Chaos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science), and had become a little obsessed with things like fractals and chaos theory. Since I was studying AI, and specializing in machine learning, I was curious to see if the two could be combined. I wrote a short proposal containing three possible ways to combine the two fields, and sent it off to potential supervisors.

Together with my supervisor (<a href="http://pieter-adriaans.nl">Pieter Adriaans</a>, who would later also become my promotor), I landed on the topic of fractals to be combined with machine learning. I approached the topic from various angles, each of which became a chapter. Back then, we could still write thesis of over a hundred pages. 

None of the results were truly convincing by themselves, but taken together, I think there is hint there of something that we still haven't quite comprehended, even in the age of machine learning. One idea that I didn't have time to work out in my master's ultimately became a chapter of my PhD thesis: [the use of the EM algorithm in fitting Iterated Function Systems to data](/publications/fractal-em-algorithm).
