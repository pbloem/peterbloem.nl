# Unraveling principal component analysis

This book collects my writing on principal component analysis. It's a long-form mathematics book. That means it dives deep into the fundamentals and works out all the relevant details, but it does so in a _narrative fashion_: it doesn't just give you a selection of dry and overly brief proofs, it tells a story.
