# Machine Learning

Starting in 2018 I redesigned, coordinated and gave the lectures for the Machine Learning course of the 3rd year BSc students at the VU University computer science programs. This is a large-scale course with a wide variety of students.

Course materials [are available online](https://mlvu.github.io) and lectures are [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pve3oIvxa8&index=1&list=PLCof9EqayQgupldnTvqNy_BThTcME5r93).
