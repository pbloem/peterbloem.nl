# Deep learning

Starting in 2019 I helped to coordinate, and provided some of the lectures for, the course _Deep learning_ at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.

Course materials [are available online](https://dlvu.github.io) and lectures are [available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@dlvu6202/playlists).
