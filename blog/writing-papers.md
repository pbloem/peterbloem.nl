This is a writing guide. There are many like it, but this one is mine. When I supervise students and PhD students, I find myself repeating a lot of the same advice. I'm a computer scientist, so whenever I repeat something three times, I start thinking about ways to automate it. This is that automatic, a bundling of what I consider the most important advice on writing. 

<aside>If I am your supervisor please note that the point of such automation is not to reduce our interactions, but to allow us to focus on what is specific to your case. I just want to get the boilerplate out of the way.

The main audience, therefore, is students, and PhD students early in their program. The main topic is how to write papers. Specifically computer science papers, which are usually fairly dry, to-the-point pieces of about 10 to 15 pages. Some of it may be useful to others and for other goals, but as we will see, it's good to have a clear idea of what you're writing and whom it's for. 

What we will also see is that it's important to have a clear idea of the larger structure. In this case, it'll be chronological: we'll start at the beginning of the writing process and work our way forward step by step.

## Before you start

Perhaps the biggest mistake people make is to think that writing only what happens when you sit behind the computer and punch keys. When they are meant to be writing, and they haven't done exactly that, they chastize themselves. They feel they've procrastinated. Even worse, they'll just sit there, staring at the blank page, trying to resist theurge to check Twitter.

The truth is, that writing, when it's done properly, when it's _pleasurable_, happens for a large part away from the keyboard. People who write frequently and with relative ease, keep ideas in their head for as long as possible. They Build them up, flesh them out, do research, read about the topic. 

This is my first piece of advice: if you can possibly avoid it, don't sit down to write until you're ready to write. If you have the luxury, deadlines being what they are, go for a walk, sit on a park bench, talk about the subject to a friend. Anything to clarify the picture in your head before you actually start tapping away at those keys.

If the idea is too big to keep in your head, or you're worried you'll forget, keep notes. Draw diagrams, or short lists of some of the topics you'd like to address. Do the kind of writing that isn't writing, and don't beat yourself up about it. If you take the time to do this first, you'll almost certainly have an easier time once you do finally sit down at the keyboard. 

And when you get stuck again, instead of opening Twitter, get up, and do some writing without writing.

## Drafting 

Here's a painting I like. 

-- pick one. Something a bit elaborate. Rembrandt?

How do you imagine te painter created this work? Do you imagine that he started at the top left corner, deposited some paint, move right a bit, deposited some more paint, scanning left-to-right over the whole canvas like an inkjet printer? It seems unlikely.

And yet, that is how many peoplestart to write. They open their word processor or text editor, start at the top of the document and work their way downward, writing each sentence after the next. To be fair fair, this makes a little more sense in writing than in painting, since it corresponds to the way the reader consumer the text, but that doesn't mean that we can't look at how the painter works, and take some inspiration from their process.

In general, the first thing a painter will do is to make a series of mini-sketches&mdash;these days often called thumbnails. Their purpose is not to reflect any detail of the painting, but only its larger composition. In such a sketch a head may be represented by just a circle. The lack of details allows the painter to focus on the large-scale composition of the piece. The fact that it took them all of 10 seconds to draw also means they won't have any difficulty discarding it in favor of another option. If the sketch were more elaborate, that might be more difficult to do.

-- some thumbnails

After these, the painter will usually pick one approach, and work it out in more detail. If the idea works, they'll keep going, adding more detail, and if it doesn't they'll go back to the thumbnail. Then, they switch from sketch to paint, and start on the canvas that will actually become the finished product. Still, they will work in broad strokes first, blocking our contrasts of light and dark, choosing a general color palet. And then bit by bit, they will refine and polish different sections, slowly working from the big picture down to the finest details.

-- Painting process

The main inspiration we can take from this is to **work in broad strokes first**. We should figure what the writing equivalent of a sketch, and of a composition is and try to spend some time on these, before we start our final canvas.

For some reason everybody knows what a sketch is, but almost nobody is ever taught what the writing equivalent of a sketch is. Before we get to that, let's look at what the main thing is we want to achieve with it. 

The painter draws thumbnails in order to achieve a powerful _composition_. Once the painter has decided roughly what to depict, these elements should be placed in some logical and expressive visual relation to one another. In writing, we want to achieve something similar, but not quite the same. Once we have ageneral idea of what sort of things we want to say we want to place them in a logical order. So far so similar.

Where things change is that in writing, and especially in academic writing, things often have strong _dependencies_. To my knowledge, Stephen Pinker was the first to explicitly point out that all the concepts that you want to talk about form a network of interrelated concepts. Yet the story you tell in your text must be entirely linear. 

-- example

This is one of the things that makes writing difficult: figuring out in what order to talk through your subjects. Your ideas are a forest of interconnected subjects, and it;s your job to plan a walk through that forest. Some of the decisions will be simple logical necessity: A needs to be introduced before B. Others will be more aesthetic: A is simply more important than B or A is simpler to understand, so the reader will be primed for B. It's up to you, and there is usually more than one way to walk a forest.

The point is that it's good to think about this a little before you start writing in actual sentences. And just like the painter has his thumbnails, we have our tools too. Which brings us to probably the best sentence in the most famous writing manual of all.

"Make the paragraph the unit of composition"<br>
&ndash;The elements of style, Strunk & White

At first blush, like much of Strunk and White, this may be a little too abstract to see what they're getting at. The point is that when you think about your text, you should **plan in paragraphs**. Think about your opening paragraph, what is the main thing you want to convey? Most likely stating the subject, which is usually the problem you want to solve. If you can't state it right away, you may need on paragraph before that to set up the context.  Do you need to explain why it's an important problem? That could be the job of the next pargraph. Now, most papers have a paragraph that states the contributions explicitly. This is a good idea; if you want one of these, you have to plot a course from the opening to this paragraph. Ideally in logical steps so that each pargraph feels like a logical consequence of the previous. 

This is what Strunk and White mean by _using the paragraph as a unit of composition_. You give each paragraph a job, just one job, and then you chain them together in a logical story. This kind of plan is the writer's equivalent of a thumbnail. You try a few of these "paragraph chains", and you see which you like best. Does the story flow logically? Does it get to the point quickly enough? Are there things you could save for later?

The key idea underpinnging this approach is that a paragraph should have only one job, only one thing to say. If you find yourself with a paragraph that is doing two jobs. Split that bad boy in two. This simplifies the job of composition into two simple steps:
 1) Figure out what the things you want to say are. Break them down into paragraph-sized chunks. The sort of thing you can summarize for yourself in a single sentence.
 2) Find a logical way to chain these together in a single linear format. Make sure you explain everything in the right order, that the important stuff comes before the secondary stuff, and wherever possible, try to make each paragraph follow logically from the previous.

What does something like that actually look like? Practically? For me it's usually something I do in my head. I don't particularly need to write it down, or capture it in some way. However, if you're starting out, it may be easier to externalize it a bit more. This has the added benefit of giving you something to show to your supervisor or your co-authors.

In this case, a good trick is to write a chain of **topic sentences**. A topic sentence is a sentence that starts a paragraph. It states, as boldly as possible what the paragraph intends to convey. The rest of the sentences then only serve to refine this basic statement. Very often, a topic sentence is a perfect way to actually open a paragraph. If not, you can still keep it there in brackets to remind yourself what the paragraph is supposed to accomplish.

-- example. Topic sentences for the previous section?

Once you have your chain of topic sentences written out, it may be difficult to see whether it's any good. This is something that comes with experience. The thumbnails work for the painter because they can identify problems early. They can tell from a sketch that a certain composition may get them into trouble later in the process. The only way to learn this is to go through the process from sketch to painting a few times. The more you do it, the earlier you can spot problems.
